           <dt> Healthy Cats</dt>
           <dd>If you come across a healthy cat in <br>your neighborhood, don’t be too <br>quick to assume it’s a stray or has <br>been abandoned. The cat might <br>belong to one of your neighbors and <br>likes to explore the outdoors. Please <br>note that ACC doesn’t accept <br>healthy stray cats. We kindly <br>recommend that you return the cat <br>to where you found it so it can easily <br>find its way back home.</dd>
           <dt>Sick or Injured Cats</dt>
           <dd> If you spot a cat that is visibly sick <br>or injured, please email CommunityCats@nycacc.org <br>so we can determine if the cat <br>needs assistance and, if so, how to <br>provide it. Do not try to handle or <br>physically restrain an aggressive or <br>fearful cat.</dd>       
           <dt>Still Unsure</dt>
           <dd>If you’re still unsure if the cat is lost <br>or abandoned, check for a tipped <br>ear, collar, or microchip (at a shelter <br>or vet clinic). If they have a tipped <br>ear, you’ve found a community cat! <br>It means they live outdoors, have a <br>caretaker, and have been sterilized <br>and vaccinated. If the cat has a collar <br>or tags, consider contacting the <br>owner to find the cat’s home.</dd>
           <dt>Report</dt>
           <dd>You can always report the cat as <br>found on Petco Love Lost to ensure <br>word gets out that this cat is <br>roaming your neighborhood. If you <br>contact an owner or a community <br>cat caretaker, you can remove the <br>listing from Petco Love Lost later.</dd>
