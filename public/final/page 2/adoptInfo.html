                <p class="adopt-info-paragraph-between">
                    Rafeeq is dedicated to helping animals find their forever homes.<br>
                    Our platform allows individuals to post their pets for adoption <br>
                    while also showcasing animals directly under Rafeeq’s care.<br>
                    Each adoption involves a small fee, which helps cover care<br>
                    and medical expenses.<br>
                    Fees vary based on the type of animal and their age, ensuring<br>
                    a fair process for all adopters.<br>
