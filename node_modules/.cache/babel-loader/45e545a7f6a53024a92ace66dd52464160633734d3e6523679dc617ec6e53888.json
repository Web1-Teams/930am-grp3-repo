Here at Rafeeq, \r\n              we reunite hundreds of animals yearly because of microchips! If your pet is not microchipped, please have one implanted immediately! If your pet is microchipped, call the company to ensure the info is up-to-date. A microchip MUST be updated manually every time you move or change your contact info. \"\r\n              />\r\n              <Accordion\r\n              buttonContant=\"  Have Details and a Photo Ready\"\r\n              pContant=\"Always keep updated information and a recent photo of your pet in case they go missing.\"\r\n              />\r\n              <Accordion\r\n              buttonContant=\"Collars, Tags, and Leashes\"\r\n              pContant=\"Ensure your pets are wearing proper identification and are kept safe with leashes.\"\r\n              />\r\n              <Accordion\r\n              buttonContant=\"Dog License\"\r\n              pContant=\" A dog license ensures your pet is easily identifiable by local authorities.\"\r\n              />\r\n               <Accordion\r\n              buttonContant=\"Protective Barriers\"\r\n              pContant=\" Use protective barriers to keep pets safe indoors or in secured outdoor areas.\"\r\n              />\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n        </div>\r\n     </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Hanis_page;\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,UAAU,MAAM,cAAc;AACrC,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,aAAa;AACnC,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,WAAW;AAC/B,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,QAAQ;AACzB,OAAOC,WAAW,MAAM,eAAe;AACvC,OAAO,iBAAiB;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA,EAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AACxB,SAASC,UAAUA,CAAA,EAAG;EACpB,oBACEH,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,eACAJ,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,gBACAJ,OAAA;QAAKK,KAAK,EAAC,sBAAsB;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACjCJ,OAAA,CAACJ,OAAO;UAAAU,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC,CAAC,eACVT,OAAA,CAACF,WAAW;UAAAQ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACT,CAAC,eAENT,OAAA,CAACN,UAAU;QACTgB,MAAM,EAAG,uBAAuB;QAChCC,SAAS,EAAE,QAAQ;QACnBC,eAAe,EAAG,2QAAsQ;QACxRC,SAAS,EAAG,2BAA2B;QAEvCC,UAAU,EAAE,aAAa;QACzBC,gBAAgB,EAAG,yHAAyH;QAC5IC,UAAU,EAAG,6CAA6C;QAE1DC,UAAU,EAAE,gBAAgB;QAC7BC,gBAAgB,EAAG,oIAAoI;QACvJC,UAAU,EAAG,gCAAgC;QAE7CC,UAAU,EAAE,OAAO;QACnBC,gBAAgB,EAAG,iHAAiH;QACpIC,UAAU,EAAG;MAAgC;QAAAhB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC3C,CAAC,eAIFT,OAAA,CAACN,UAAU;QACVgB,MAAM,EAAG,kCAAkC;QAC3CC,SAAS,EAAE,gBAAgB;QAC3BC,eAAe,EAAG,uPAAkP;QACpQC,SAAS,EAAG,2BAA2B;QAEvCC,UAAU,EAAE,mBAAmB;QAC/BC,gBAAgB,EAAG,+JAA0J;QAC7KC,UAAU,EAAG,0BAA0B;QAEvCC,UAAU,EAAE,sBAAsB;QACnCC,gBAAgB,EAAG,qHAAqH;QACxIC,UAAU,EAAG,gCAAgC;QAE7CC,UAAU,EAAE,OAAO;QACnBC,gBAAgB,EAAG,kHAAkH;QACrIC,UAAU,EAAG;MAAgC;QAAAhB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC5C,CAAC,eAEHT,OAAA,CAACN,UAAU;QACTgB,MAAM,EAAG,0CAA0C;QACnDC,SAAS,EAAE,cAAc;QACzBC,eAAe,EAAG,sYAAuX;QACzYC,SAAS,EAAG,uBAAuB;QAEnCC,UAAU,EAAE,sBAAsB;QAClCC,gBAAgB,EAAG,qPAAqP;QACxQC,UAAU,EAAG,+BAA+B;QAE5CC,UAAU,EAAE,cAAc;QAC3BC,gBAAgB,EAAG,2XAA4W;QAC/XC,UAAU,EAAG,4BAA4B;QAEzCC,UAAU,EAAE,QAAQ;QACpBC,gBAAgB,EAAG,4OAA4O;QAC/PC,UAAU,EAAG;MAA2B;QAAAhB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACvC,CAAC,eACFT,OAAA;QAASuB,EAAE,EAAC,WAAW;QAAClB,KAAK,EAAC,6BAA6B;QAAAD,QAAA,eACvDJ,OAAA;UAAKK,KAAK,EAAC,gBAAgB;UAACmB,KAAK,EAAE;YAACC,MAAM,EAAE,oBAAoB;YAAEC,eAAe,EAAC;UAAS,CAAE;UAAAtB,QAAA,eAC3FJ,OAAA;YAAKK,KAAK,EAAC,KAAK;YAAAD,QAAA,gBACdJ,OAAA;cAAKK,KAAK,EAAE,kBAAkB;cAAAD,QAAA,eAC9BJ,OAAA,CAACH,IAAI;gBAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAC;YAAC;cAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OACF,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;cAAKK,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;cAAAD,QAAA,eACzBJ,OAAA;gBAAKK,KAAK,EAAC,WAAW;gBAACkB,EAAE,EAAC,kBAAkB;gBAAAnB,QAAA,gBAC5CJ,OAAA,CAACL,SAAS;kBACVgC,aAAa,EAAC,WAAW;kBACzBC,QAAQ,EAAC;gBACmS;kBAAAtB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;kBAAAC,UAAA;kBAAAC,YAAA;gBAAA,OAC3S,CAAC,eACFT,OAAA,CAACL,SAAS;kBACVgC,aAAa,EAAC,kCAAkC;kBAChDC,QAAQ,EAAC;gBAAyF;kBAAAtB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;kBAAAC,UAAA;kBAAAC,YAAA;gBAAA,OACjG,CAAC,eACFT,OAAA,CAACL,SAAS;kBACVgC,aAAa,EAAC,4BAA4B;kBAC1CC,QAAQ,EAAC;gBAAoF;kBAAAtB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;kBAAAC,UAAA;kBAAAC,YAAA;gBAAA,OAC5F,CAAC,eACFT,OAAA,CAACL,SAAS;kBACVgC,aAAa,EAAC,aAAa;kBAC3BC,QAAQ,EAAC;gBAA8E;kBAAAtB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;kBAAAC,UAAA;kBAAAC,YAAA;gBAAA,OACtF,CAAC,eACDT,OAAA,CAACL,SAAS;kBACXgC,aAAa,EAAC,qBAAqB;kBACnCC,QAAQ,EAAC;gBAAiF;kBAAAtB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;kBAAAC,UAAA;kBAAAC,YAAA;gBAAA,OACzF,CAAC;cAAA;gBAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OACK;YAAC;cAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OACH,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACH;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACC,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACL;EAAC,gBACP,CAAC;AAER;AAACoB,EAAA,GAxGQ1B,UAAU;AA0GnB,eAAeA,UAAU;AAAC,IAAA0B,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
